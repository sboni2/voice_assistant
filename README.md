# OIBSIP Voice Assistant

A lightweight Python voice assistant built as part of the OIBSIP–OASIS Infobyte Internship program. It listens to user commands and helps with everyday tasks—all through voice interactions!

# Core Features

* Friendly Greetings
  Automatically greets the user with “Good morning/afternoon/evening” based on the current time.

* Conversational Responses
  Recognizes casual commands like “hello” and responds with a warm, human-like reply.

* Date & Time Information
  Instantly tells you the current date or time when prompted.

* Knowledge Retrieval
  Fetches brief summaries from Wikipedia on user queries.

* Web Search
  Opens Google search results directly in your default browser.

* Quick Launches
  Supports launching popular websites like YouTube, Google, and music services with voice commands.

# Learning Outcomes & Challenges Tackled

1. Speech Recognition
   Learned to capture and transcribe spoken input using `speech_recognition` and Google’s Voice API.

2. Text‑to‑Speech
   Gained insights into voice-output using `pyttsx3`.

3. Natural Language Command Parsing
   Developed logic to interpret various voice commands and map them to actions.

4. Integration with External Services
   Connected to Wikipedia and web browsers to fetch live data and navigate the web.

5. Robust Error Handling
   Managed misheard input, network issues, and missing resources gracefully, providing friendly prompts to the user.

# Why This Project Matters

This voice assistant serves as a practical introduction to voice-based computing. It's:

* Developer-focused: Easy to understand, modify, and extend.
* Engaging: Visual feedback (time/date summaries, Wikipedia text) combined with voice outputs makes it fun.
* Buildable: A strong foundation for richer personal assistants—e.g., adding weather info, music playback, even home automation.

# Usage & Contribution Guidelines

* Built with:
  `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `wikipedia`, `webbrowser`, and Python’s standard library.

* Getting Started:

  1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.
  2. Run `voice_assistant.py` locally with an active mic and speakers.
  3. Speak commands like “hello,” “time,” “search Python programming,” or “wikipedia Tesla.”

* Extendable by design:
  Easily plug in new features—weather forecasts, reminders, jokes, and more.

---

# Recommended Next Steps

* Add voice wake-words to constantly listen for your name (e.g., “Hey Assistant”).
* Integrate online APIs for weather, news, or to control IoT devices.
* Introduce a GUI interface to display recognized text and responses visually.

# Internship Summary

By building this assistant, interns gain hands-on experience with speech technologies, practical coding patterns, and service integrations—fueling deeper exploration into voice-enabled applications.
